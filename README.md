#  A Portfolio with Gatsby

Gatsby is a React framework for websites (and not only static websites).

Following [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzWIUX3CpuI)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

0.  **Install Gatsby**

    ```sh
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new portfolio https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd portfolio
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `portfolio` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
